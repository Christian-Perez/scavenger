## <SCREENSHOT>

##Description
  <scavenger> is a single player scavenger hunt game played on a mobile app, in which players can start scavenger hunts from a hunt template provided by an api. Each hunt will have a description, duration, objectives, & a map defining the boundaries of the playing field. i.e. where the user can find the answers to the riddles in each game. The objective of <scavenger> is to solve all the riddles or "objectives" in a hunt <before time runs out> OR <as fast as possible>.

### Plans for Further Development
  Multiplayer Events - Players will be able to join 'Hunt Events' with specific start / end times
  Team Games - Players can create / join teams & play against other single players or teams

##technologies & Concepts
  ####Technologies used:
  HTML
  CSS
  JAVASCRIPT
  Ionic

##Approach Taken
  I plan to begin building <scavenger> by building out an api to serve hunts, excluding map data, to the client app (ionic app).


  Once i can request all the information needed form the api & associate information (hunt data) with a user i will begin building the ionic
